# Summative_Assignment_1: Linear Regression, Random Forest and Decision Trees

In this assignment, I developed and optimised a linear regression model, as well as created decision trees and random forests to predict TV sales. I evaluated the models' performance by comparing their Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE).

## Important Notes
- Ensure all cells requiring code snippets are completed.
- Pass all unit tests in the notebook to demonstrate your model's correctness.
- Document your process and findings clearly within the notebook to assist with grading.
